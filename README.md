# Tenzies

This project was to help refresh my React knowledge and also learn to use functional based components instead of class based components.

## Description

Tenzies is a simple dice game where the player has to roll the dice until all dies are the same value. The values can be frozen by simply clicking on them.

Highscores are also kept in local storage (lowest rolls to win and lowest time to win)

## Scripts

In the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`
